# LiveKit Deployment Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the LiveKit voice-MCP agent deployment, covering all components from infrastructure to application level.

## Architecture Under Test

### Core Components
- **LiveKit Server**: Real-time communication server (port 7880)

### Network Topology
```
Internet → Caddy (443) → LiveKit (7880)
                      ↓
         Redis (6379) ↔ Ingress (1935/8080)
